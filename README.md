## About The Project

RentNScoot allows to rent electric scooters for a certain period of time and return them afterwards. 
The scooters, locations, personal data of the user and information needed for the rental process are stored in a SQLite database 
and can be read out and displayed in dynamic lists at any given time. The application was developed completely in the programming 
language C# and WPF in the frontend.
